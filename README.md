This course is available on Coursera, and here is my own note about this course.

## Module 1

### Definition and Uses of Models, Common Functions

#### What is a model?

* A formal ***description*** of a business process.
* It typically involves ***mathematical equations*** and random variables.
* It is almost always a ***simplification*** of a more complex structure.
* It typically relies upon a set of ***assumptions***.
* It is usually implemented in a ***computer program*** or using a spreadsheet.

#### Examples of models

* The price of a diamond as a function of its weight.
* The spread of an epidemic over time.
* The relationship between demand for, and price of a product.
* The uptake of a new product in a market.
