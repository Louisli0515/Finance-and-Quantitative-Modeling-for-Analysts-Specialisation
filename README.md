This course is available on Coursera, and here is my own note about this course.

## Module 1

### Definition and Uses of Models, Common Functions

#### What is a model?

* A formal ***description*** of a business process.
* It typically involves ***mathematical equations*** and random variables.
* It is almost always a ***simplification*** of a more complex structure.
* It typically relies upon a set of ***assumptions***.
* It is usually implemented in a ***computer program*** or using a spreadsheet.

#### Examples of models

* The price of a diamond as a function of its weight.
* The spread of an epidemic over time.
* The relationship between demand for, and price of a product.
* The uptake of a new product in a market.

#### Diamonds and weight

#### Spread of an epidemic

#### Demand models

#### The uptake of a new product

### How models are used in practice

#### Ways to use models in practice

* Prediction: Calculating a single output: What's the expected price of a diamond ring that weighs 0.2 carats?
* Forecasting (time series): How many people are expected to be infected in 6 weeks?
* Optimisation: What price maximises profit?
* Ranking and targeting: Given limited resources, which potential diamonds for sale should be targeted first for potential purchase?
* Exploring what-if scenarios: If the growth rate of the epidemic increased to $20%$ per week, then how many infections would we expect in the next 10 weeks?
* Interpreting coefficients in model: What do we learn from the coefficient -2.5 in the price/demand model?
* Assessing how sensitive the model is to key assumptions.

#### Benefits of modeling

* Identify gaps in current understanding
* Make assumptions explicit
* Have a well-defined description of the business process
* Create an institutional memory
* Used as a decision support tool
* Serendipitous insight generator
